This module builds a testware artifact.
The plugin is configured centrally for all testware in the integration pom.

After a release version (non SNAPSHOT) is built the CI Fwk database needs to be updated.
This update is triggered when this file, testware, is present.
Rename this file, using 'git mv', to temporarily disable updates of the datebase.

For more information on testware please see the confluence page at
